Earlier this year I have
[blogged](https://ctor.io/update-your-sample-items-to-use-asp-net-mvc/) about a
Sitecore package to convert the Sitecore sample items to use MVC based
presentation. With Sitecore 8, you still need this package when you want to turn
the presentation to MVC. But it does not fully work as Sitecore has changed the
markup for the sample renderings.

I have updated this package to work with the new layout for Sitecore 8. So if
you need to test some MVC implementations on a clean Sitecore 8 installation,
this should help you easily start with it.

The package can be installed over the [Sitecore Installation
Wizard](http://sitecoreguild.blogspot.ch/2013/03/quickstart-installing-sitecore-packages.html).

_Update: The previous package (version 2.0) was built on the Technical Preview
of Sitecore 8. Because the final release has a different layout, I have updated
the package to version 3.0._
